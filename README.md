# Airline Review Analysis

This project focuses on scraping and analyzing customer reviews for airlines. The goal is to extract valuable insights from user feedback regarding flight services, crew, seat comfort, and overall satisfaction. Through sentiment analysis, we aim to identify the strengths and areas for improvement in airline services.

## Project Flow

1. **Data Collection**:  
   The first step involves scraping airline reviews from various online sources. The raw data is collected in the form of textual reviews, which contain feedback on flight services, crew, seat comfort, and other aspects of the airline experience.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:  
   After collecting the reviews, the raw data in `BA_reviews_raw.csv` is cleaned. This involves removing irrelevant information, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis. The goal is to structure the data so that it is ready for sentiment analysis.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:  
   The sentiment analysis is performed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to categorize reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. This analysis helps in understanding customer perceptions based on their feedback. The sentiment score is calculated for each review, which provides insights into the overall satisfaction levels.

4. **Insight Generation**:  
   Through the sentiment analysis, key themes and insights are derived, such as common complaints (e.g., flight delays, poor seat comfort) and positive feedback (e.g., excellent crew). These insights highlight the critical factors that contribute to customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

5. **Report Generation**:  
   After analysis, a comprehensive report is generated in the form of a PDF document (`Airline Review Analysis.pdf`). The report includes an executive summary, key findings, and recommendations for improvements in airline services based on the analysis of customer feedback.

6. **Next Steps**:  
   Based on the insights, actionable next steps are outlined to improve customer satisfaction. This might include focusing on addressing specific complaints, enhancing service quality, or monitoring specific metrics to ensure continuous improvement.

## Files in the Repository

- **Airline Reviews Scrapping & Analysis.ipynb**:  
  This Jupyter notebook contains the code for scraping the reviews, cleaning and preprocessing the data, performing sentiment analysis, and generating insights. It also includes visualizations to help interpret the data.
  
- **Airline Review Analysis.pdf**:  
  This PDF document summarizes the findings of the analysis, providing insights and recommendations based on the data. It serves as a comprehensive report of the projectâ€™s results.
  
- **BA_reviews_raw.csv**:  
  This CSV file contains the raw data extracted from airline review websites. It includes review texts along with metadata such as review dates and ratings.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project and replicate the analysis:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` or installing the necessary libraries manually (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk).
3. Open the Jupyter notebook **Airline Reviews Scrapping & Analysis.ipynb** in a Jupyter Notebook environment or compatible IDE (like VSCode) to execute the code and start analyzing the reviews.
4. After running the notebook, you can review the insights in the **Airline Review Analysis.pdf** report, which provides a detailed summary of the findings.

## Key Insights from the Analysis

- **Flight & Service**: Negative sentiments are dominated by issues related to flight delays, cancellations, and service quality, with a strong need for improvement in these areas.
- **Crew & Seat**: Customers provide positive feedback about the crew, but complaints about seat comfort are frequent in negative reviews, indicating the need for improvements in seating arrangements.

## Next Steps

Based on the insights:

- **Improve Flight & Service Quality**: Focus on resolving flight delays and cancellations and improving the quality of customer service, which are major sources of negative feedback.
- **Enhance Seat Comfort**: Since seat comfort is a frequent complaint, it is crucial to look into ways to make seats more comfortable to improve customer experience.
